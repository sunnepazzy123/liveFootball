### Installation

 ```
    npm install 
    npm start 
 ```


### Testing
i implemented unit testing but was not able to write enough of the unit test because i really didn't understand the full context of the question.

i can implement more test but i have to be sure on what unit i am testing to be specific, and i really didn't know if we want Integration testing, that is why i did not go further in my testing because it was written that i should keep it simple, but i was able to test some of the unit.

 ```
    npm test
 ```
